        AND INGREDIENTS, WITH PRINTABLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR BREAD MACHINE.
        I love to cook and I am a pretty confident baker, however, one thing I’ve struggled with is 
        finding a really incredible bread recipe. I know- kind of funny being as there are a zillion 
        out there and bread is one of those ‘basics” that almost anyone can make themselves. Nevertheless, 
        I keep trying new recipes and have finally found one I really like and have gotten good results from!
        Even better- it’s easy and from start to finish it takes just over 2 hours!</p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul> 
        <li> Yeast </li>
        <li> Flour </li>
        <li> Salt </li>
        <li> Vegtable Oil </li>
        <li> Warm Water </li>

    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol> 
        <li> STEP 1: ASSEMBLE BREAD INGREDIENTS
            You’ll need warm water, granulated sugar, instant OR active dry yeast, salt, 
            vegetable or canola oil and flour. That’s it!</li>
        <li> 
            STEP 2: DISSOLVE THE YEAST AND ACTIVATE IT BY PROOFING
            This is a simple process that takes about 5 minutes. You can see a picture 
            below what yeast looks like when it’s proofed. It’s possible to kill yeast if you use 
            too hot of water, so aim for slightly warmer than luke-warm, or about 105°F. Combine warm 
            water, yeast and 1 TBSP of the granulated sugar in your mixing bowl. Give it a quick stir 
            and then let it sit for 5 minutes. You’ll begin to see the yeast puff up until it covers the 
            entire surface of the water.

        <li> STEP 3: ADD REMAINING INGREDIENTS AND MIX
            Add the rest of the sugar, the oil, salt and flour (You can use all-purpose flour 
            OR bread flour!), then mix using an electric mixer until it’s well combined, about 2
             minutes. You can mix by hand but it will take longer.</li>
        <li> STEP 4: KNEAD THE BREAD
            You might be thinking, “Wait! It’s already mixed!” Ha! Not so fast! Going through the 
            process of kneading bread dough is crucial for bread with great texture. Kneading dough 
            allows gluten to form which enables dough to rise better, be lighter and fluffier. you can 
            knead by hand or with a mixer. I use the dough hook on my mixer and knead for 7 minutes. 
            If you knead by hand, you’ll want to knead for 10-11 minutes, depending on how consistent 
            you are.</li>
