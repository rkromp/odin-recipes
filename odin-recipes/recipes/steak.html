    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul> 
        <li> NY Strip Steak </li>
        <li>  Cloves of Garlic </li>
        <li> Rosemary </li>
        <li> Butter </li>

    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol> 
        <li> Pat Dry - use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce 
            oil splatter.</li>
        <li> Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt 
            and pepper.</li>
        <li> Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs 
            to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge). </li>
        <li> Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan 
            to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
        <li> Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
